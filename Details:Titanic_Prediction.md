# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction Project

## 📋 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. Using the Titanic dataset, I built a complete end-to-end data science solution that includes:

- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** for data analysis, preprocessing, and machine learning.
- **Power BI Dashboard** for interactive visual exploration.
- **Machine Learning Model** to predict survival outcomes.

## 🛠️ What I've Done

### 1. Data Analysis and Preprocessing
- Loaded and cleaned the dataset using **pandas**.
- Performed **feature engineering** (e.g., extracted titles from names, created family size feature).
- Handled missing values appropriately.
- Used **EDA** (Exploratory Data Analysis) to understand important survival factors like gender, class, fare, and age.

### 2. Power BI Dashboard
- Designed an **interactive dashboard** in **Power BI Desktop**.
- Visualized survival rates based on:
  - Gender
  - Passenger Class
  - Age Groups
  - Fare Ranges
- Made it easier to spot patterns and factors influencing survival through dynamic charts and slicers.

### 3. Machine Learning Model
- Built and trained machine learning models using **scikit-learn**:
  - **Logistic Regression** (baseline model)
  - **Random Forest Classifier** (final model after hyperparameter tuning)
- Evaluated models using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
- Achieved strong predictive performance on test data.
