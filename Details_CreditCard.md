# 🛡️ Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

## 📋 Project Overview  
This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. It is part of my internship tasks under the CodSoft program.

The goal is to preprocess transaction data, address class imbalance, and train a robust classification model to accurately distinguish between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.

## 🛠️ What I've Done

### 1. Data Preprocessing & Normalization
- Imported and explored the dataset using **pandas** and **seaborn/matplotlib**.
- Normalized numerical features for better model performance.
- Handled class imbalance using **oversampling** and **undersampling** techniques (e.g., **SMOTE**).
- Split the dataset into training and test sets.

### 2. Model Building
- Trained classification models using **scikit-learn**, including:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Random Forest Classifier
- Tuned hyperparameters using **GridSearchCV**.

### 3. Model Evaluation
- Evaluated model performance using metrics:
  - **Precision**
  - **Recall**
  - **F1-Score**
  - **Confusion Matrix**
- Focused on maximizing **F1-score** due to the imbalanced nature of the dataset.

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- How to tackle **imbalanced classification problems**.
- Importance of **precision-recall trade-offs** in fraud detection.
- Application of various **resampling techniques** to improve model robustness.
- Real-world modeling and evaluation of classification tasks using **Python** and **scikit-learn**.
