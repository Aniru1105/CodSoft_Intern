# 🎬 Movie Rating Prediction Project

## 📋 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to **predict the rating of a movie** based on features such as **genre, director, and actors**. It's part of my internship task at **CodSoft**.

The goal is to analyze historical movie data and create a regression-based solution to estimate how a movie might be rated by users or critics.

- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** for data analysis, preprocessing, and modeling.
- Explored how different features contribute to the predicted rating using regression techniques.

## 🛠️ What I've Done

### 1. Data Analysis and Preprocessing
- Imported and explored the dataset using **pandas** and **matplotlib/seaborn**.
- Checked for missing values and handled them effectively.
- Performed **feature encoding** for categorical variables like genre, director, and actors.
- Normalized/standardized features where necessary.

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Created new meaningful features to improve model performance.
- Used **one-hot encoding**, **label encoding**, and basic NLP techniques to process text data (if applicable).

### 3. Regression Model Building
- Trained multiple regression models using **scikit-learn**, including:
  - **Linear Regression**
  - **Ridge Regression**
  - **Random Forest Regressor**
- Evaluated models using:
  - **R² Score**
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- How to process and model multi-category categorical data in real-world datasets.
- The impact of feature selection and encoding on regression performance.
- Building interpretable and scalable prediction pipelines using **Python and scikit-learn**.
